Hello! I am a data journalist / data analyst. I've worked for CoStar News as a data visualization journalist, and as a news reporter with Telegram & Gazette, USA TODAY Network. At CoStar, I was in charge of all things data visualization at costar.com, and from time to time I produced real estate stories with data, as well as collaborated with reporters on data enterprise stories. I also managed CoStar's news traffic dashboard by utilizing SQL as well as Power BI as a data analyst role within the organization.
